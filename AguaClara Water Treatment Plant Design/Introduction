# Introduction to AguaClara water treatment design


During the later half of the 20th century surface water treatment technologies evolved slowly. The slow evolution was likely a product of the regulatory environment, the high cost of water treatment infrastructure, and the low profit margin. The high cost of municipal scale water treatment infrastructure made experiments at scale infeasible. With little opportunity for a significant return on investment there was little incentive to invest in the research and development that could have advanced the technologies. A final disincentive was the widely held belief that surface water treatment was a mature field with little opportunity for significant advancement. The advances of the latter half of the 20th century focused primarily on mechanization, automation, and improved monitoring.

Mechanized and automated water treatment plants performed reasonably well in communities with ready access to technical support services and supply chains that could deliver replacement parts. In the global south municipal water treatment plants didn't fare as well.

The AguaClara program was founded in 2005 with the goal of creating a new generation of sustainable technologies that would perform well even in the rugged settings of rural communities.
