# Rapid Mix
Rapid mix is where the process of changing the surface properties of both suspended particles and dissolved substances begins. Rapid mix includes multiple steps that occur after the liquid coagulant is injected into the raw water stream.
* Turbulent eddies distort the fluid such that the coagulant is mixed with the raw water down to a scale of perhaps 10 times the Kolmogorov length scale.
* Diffusion blends the coagulant with the raw water sufficiently so that the coagulant precipitates and forms nanoparticles.
* Dissolved organic molecules diffuse to the coagulant nanoparticles and adhere to the nanoparticle surface.
* The coagulant nanoparticles are transported to suspended particle surfaces by a combination of diffusion and fluid shear.

### Coagulant attachment mechanism
* Surface charge neutralization hypothesis
  * coagulant nanoparticles attach to each other
  *
* Polar bonds
  * Electronegativity reveals that the aluminum - oxygen bond is more polar than the hydrogen - oxygen bond
  * The bond between a coagulant nanoparticle and a clay surface can potentially be stronger than the bond between a water molecule and the clay surface.



### Transport steps
* Einstein's diffusion equation
* Estimate diffusion time scale
* Kolmogorov length scale
* Possibly introduce model for shear-diffusion transport of coagulant nanoparticles to clay
* Provide estimates of the time scales for each of the processes
