# Flow Control and Measurement Cheat Sheet

## The Orifice Equation

$$Q = \Pi_{vc} A_{or} \sqrt{2g\Delta h}$$

This equation is one that you'll see again and again throughout this class. Thus, understanding where it comes from early on will be greatly beneficial in aiding your understanding of future concepts, derivations, and equations.

### Purpose
The orifice equation relates the flow out of an orifice, $Q$ to the height of the water above the orifice $\Delta h$.
