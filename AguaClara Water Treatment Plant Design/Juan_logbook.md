# Logbook for Spring 2018 CEE 4540 Updates

This file will contain weekly updates into my work. All changes will be pushed to the `Juan_class_book_work` branch. Every week (the day depends on my work schedule that week), I will send Monroe an email containing a link to this file's page on GitHub in addition to supplementary material. For example, this first week I will send him the example of the 'extra' slides for his viewing pleasure (or displeasure).

## First Progress report: Arrived in Argentina 2/7/18

### Done
1. Installed and played with atom until comfortable
1. Looked into how to handle extra slides, input from Cynthia and Zoe. Small example ready
1. Simplified a few slides- notably one on Darcy-Weisbach
1. Began to transfer equations in the powerpoints to LaTeX from MathType
    - `Flow Control and Measurement` and  `Rapid Mix` are done and uploaded to my branch.
    - Looked into changing the LaTeX math font, as I like the MathType font far more. I wasn't able to find any good options in a couple hours of searching
    - I've only got 14 more days left of MathType

### To Do
1. Finish transferring all equations to IguanaTeX before MathType runs out
1. Once all equations are transferred, branch point (my preference bolded):
    - **Update/simplify/clarify slides,** OR
    - Begin to create summary sheets for each unit process/course topic OR
    - Look into skeleton structure for textbook (equation numbering and citations)


## Second Progress report: Last day in Argentina 2/14/18

### Done
1. Completed transferring equations to LaTeX from MathType in `Flocculation Model`. Took more time than the previous topics due to its heaftier equation volume and the following bullet.
1. Began to understand the huge difficulty with work-life-family balance. As I work and my grandpa just looks at me somewhat sadly. Short-term productivity suffered.

### To Do
1. Finish transferring equations for `Flocculation Design`, `Sedimentation`, and `Filtration` powerpoints, along with the scattered extras.
    - `Sedimentation` and `Filtration` powerpoints don't appear to be in the `CEE_4540` repo. I'll take them from the 4540 syllabus. I imagine Monroe didn't change them too much since last semester.
    - I will need to purchase Mathtype, or download another free trial. I can use another email and wipe Mathtype from my computer before re-installing? I'll try that
2. Look into changing the font color on IguanaTeX. Learn more about LaTeX and IguanaTeX in general.


## Third Progress report: Last day in Abu Dhabi?

### Done
1. Figured out how to add color to the IguanaTeX equations. Not too tough, but it took longer than I would have liked.
2. Finished transferring equations for `Flocculation Model` and `Sedimentation`
