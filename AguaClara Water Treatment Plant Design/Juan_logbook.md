# Logbook for Spring 2018 CEE 4540 Updates

This file will contain weekly updates into my work. All changes will be pushed to the `Juan_class_book_work` branch. Every week (the day depends on my work schedule that week), I will send Monroe an email containing a link to this file's page on GitHub in addition to supplementary material. For example, this first week I will send him the example of the 'extra' slides for his viewing pleasure (or displeasure).

## First Progress Report: Arrived in Argentina 2/7/18

### Done
1. Installed and played with atom until comfortable
1. Looked into how to handle extra slides, input from Cynthia and Zoe. Small example ready
1. Simplified a few slides- notably one on Darcy-Weisbach
1. Began to transfer equations in the powerpoints to LaTeX from MathType
    - `Flow Control and Measurement` and  `Rapid Mix` are done and uploaded to my branch.
    - Looked into changing the LaTeX math font, as I like the MathType font far more. I wasn't able to find any good options in a couple hours of searching
    - I've only got 14 more days left of MathType

### To Do
1. Finish transferring all equations to IguanaTeX before MathType runs out
1. Once all equations are transferred, branch point (my preference bolded):
    - **Update/simplify/clarify slides,** OR
    - Begin to create summary sheets for each unit process/course topic OR
    - Look into skeleton structure for textbook (equation numbering and citations)

## Second Progress Report: Last day in Argentina 2/14/18

### Done
1. Completed transferring equations to LaTeX from MathType in `Flocculation Model`. Took more time than the previous topics due to its heaftier equation volume and the following bullet.
1. Began to understand the huge difficulty with work-life-family balance. As I work and my grandpa just looks at me somewhat sadly. Short-term productivity suffered.

### To Do
1. Finish transferring equations for `Flocculation Design`, `Sedimentation`, and `Filtration` powerpoints, along with the scattered extras.
    - `Sedimentation` and `Filtration` powerpoints don't appear to be in the `CEE_4540` repo. I'll take them from the 4540 syllabus. I imagine Monroe didn't change them too much since last semester.
    - I will need to purchase Mathtype, or download another free trial. I can use another email and wipe Mathtype from my computer before re-installing? I'll try that
1. Look into changing the font color on IguanaTeX. Learn more about LaTeX and IguanaTeX in general.

## Third Progress Report: 3 productive days in Abu Dhabi 2/21/18

### Done
1. Figured out how to add color to the IguanaTeX equations. Not too tough, but it took longer than I would have liked.
1. Finished transferring equations for:
    - `Flocculation Model`
    - `Flocculator Extras`
    - `Sedimentation`
    - `Filtration`
    - `Disinfection`
    - `Disinfection Extras`
    - `Prelim 1 Review`
    - `Prelim 2 Review`
    - Presentations that haven't been transferred to LaTeX: `Sedimentation Extras`, `Filtration Extras`, `Open Channel Flow`, `Manifolds`, and `Floc Blanket Model`, which is just a collection of slides from the Flocculation slides.
    - MathType ran out :( but I finished everything I intended to and more :D
1. Went back and labeled all the equations that were off the slides for future clarity
1. Reorganized the `Lectures` folder in GitHub. I think it is a lot more clear now.
1. Beginning to edit presentations for clarity while reformatting the extra slides. Extra slides will now be a separate powerpoint.
Extra slides finished for:
    - `Introduction`
1. Created functional "Overviews" for the following presentations:
    - `State of the planet`
    - `AguaClara Slideshow`
    - `Flow Control and Measurement`
    - `Introduction` halfway done- does it make sense to have such structure for the non-technical presentations?




### To-Do
1. Continue to edit and clarify technical presentations. This will take a long time. I will begin sequentially, with `Flow Control and Measurement`.
1. Talk to Monroe about the `Drinking Water Contaminants` presentation structure

**Non-imminent action item for Monroe**
<br>
Please go back over the non-physics/math/engineering presentations to make sure that they are of adequate length. Those presentations are, in a way, the most important ones of the course, as they inspire people. Their delivery should not be rushed. If some slides have to become 'extras' to ensure that each remaining slide is given the time and gravity it deserves, that's ok.

<br>

For the following presentations, let me know what slides you want to be considered extras, if any. You can simply add/remove the oh-so-common `extra` tag to them and push them to GitHub (once you've pulled my changes! I've made some minor edits to the non-technical presentations), I'll create the extra slide decks for them. I imagine you have a way better feel for how long the presentations should be than I do!
- `State of the planet`
- `Drinking Water Contaminants`
- `AguaClara Slideshow`
- `Public Health`
- `Last Lecture`
