# Logbook for Spring 2018 CEE 4540 Updates

This file will contain weekly updates into my work. All changes will be pushed to the `Juan_class_book_work` branch. Every week (the day depends on my work schedule that week), I will send Monroe an email containing a link to this file's page on GitHub in addition to supplementary material. For example, this first week I will send him the example of the 'extra' slides for his viewing pleasure (or displeasure).

## First Progress report: 2/7/18

### Done
1. Installed and played with atom until comfortable
1. Looked into how to handle extra slides, input from Cynthia and Zoe. Small example ready
1. Simplified a few slides- notably one on Darcy-Weisbach
1. Began to transfer equations in the powerpoints to LaTeX from MathType
  - `Flow Control and Measurement` and  `Rapid Mix` are done and uploaded to my branch.
  - I've only got 14 more days left of MathType

### To Do
1. Finish transferring all equations to IguanaTeX before MathType runs out
1. Once all equations are transferred, branch point (my preference bolded):
  - **Update/simplify/clarify slides,** OR
  - Begin to create summary sheets for each unit process/course topic OR
  - Look into skeleton structure for textbook (equation numbering and citations)
