# Deriving $Q(t)$ for a Simple Hypochlorinator

This document contains the derivation of the flow through a simple hypochlorinator using the following image as a reference. In the image, a hypochlorite solution is slowly dripping into water that is flowing into a water storage system, thereby disinfecting it. The valve is almost closed to make sure that the hypochlorite solution drips instead of flows.

This derivation begins by finding two equations for flow, $Q$, through the hypochlorinator and setting them equal to each other. First, the rate of change of the volume of hypochlorite solution in the tank is equivalent to the flow out of the hypochlorinator. Since the volume of hypochlorite solution in the tank is equal to the tank's area times it height, we get the following equation:

$$Q =  - \frac{d\rlap{-}V}{dt} = - \frac{{A_{Tank}}dh}{dt}$$

Our other equation for flow is the minor loss equation.
