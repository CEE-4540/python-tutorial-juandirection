    "Units are essential to engineering calculations. Units provide a quick check on all of our calculations to help reduce the number of errors in our analysis. Getting the right dimensions back from a calculation doesn't prove that the answer is correct, but getting the wrong dimensions back does prove that the answer is wrong! Unit errors from incorrect conversions are common when using apps that don't calculate with units. Engineering design work should always include units in the calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [pint package](https://pint.readthedocs.io/) to add unit capabilities to our calculations in Python. We have imported the `pint.UnitRegistry` as 'u' and thus all of pint's units can be used by placing a 'u.' in front of the unit name. Meters are `u.m`, seconds are `u.s`, etc. Most units are simple values that can be used just like other terms in algebraic equations. The exception to this are units that have an offset. For example, in the equation PV=nRT, temperature must be given with units that have value of zero at absolute zero. We would like to be able to enter 20 degC into that equation and have it handle the units correctly. But you can't convert from degC to Kelvin by simply multiplying by a conversion factor. Thus for temperature the units have to be handled in a special way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperatures require use of the u.Quantity function to enter the value and the units of temperature separated by a ',' rather than by a multiplication symbol. This is because it doesn't make sense to multiply by a temperature unit because temperatures (that aren't absolute temperatures) have both a slope and a nonzero intercept.\n",
