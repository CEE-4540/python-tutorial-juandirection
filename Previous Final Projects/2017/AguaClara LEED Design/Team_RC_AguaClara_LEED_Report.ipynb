    "In providing clean water to communities in Honduras, AguaClara seeks to build water treatment plants with sustainability in mind. Sustainability of the plant is paramount in avoiding risks of failure or shutdown that plague projects dependent upon proprietary expertise or supplies. AguaClara plants are cheaper and more reliable for communities by using gravity and mechanical devices to operate instead of electricity\n",

    "LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world, and provides a framework to create healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving green buildings. LEED certification is a globally recognized symbol of sustainability achievement. (1)\n",
