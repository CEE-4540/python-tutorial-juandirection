# AguaClara LEED Design

# Problem Definition

Our project looks to take a comprehensive look at AguaClara’s treatment plants impact on sustainability through the perspective of LEED building design

# Background

In providing clean water to communities in Honduras, AguaClara seeks to build water treatment plants with sustainability in mind. Sustainability of the plant is paramount in avoiding risks of failure or shutdown that plague projects dependent upon proprietary expertise or supplies. AguaClara plants are cheaper and more reliable for communities by using gravity and mechanical devices to operate instead of electricity

LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world, and provides a framework to create healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving green buildings. LEED certification is a globally recognized symbol of sustainability achievement. (1)
 
We want to look at LEED’s standard for green community buildings and apply the principles to AguaClara treatment plants.  We will evaluate the Honduras water treatment plant in the following categories:


-          Location and Transportation
-          Sustainable sites
-          Water Efficiency
-          Energy and Atmosphere
-          Materials and Resources 
-          Indoor Environmental Quality 
-          Innovation in Design
-          Regional Priority
 
Based on the LEED rubric, we can see what improvements we can make and also see if the Honduras water treatment plant qualifies for LEED certification. 
 
If possible, we will look to see if we can get AguaClara plants LEED certified.  A LEED certificate would serve as a great marketing tool and sign of the entire project’s commitment to sustainability. 
 
 We will focus our LEED evaluation on one water treatment plant in Honduras.  We look to gather as much information as possible about the plant design from students who have worked on or been to the water treatment plant, and work off of existing building documentation. 






# LEED Principles

Sustainable construction or Green Building emerged to limit the impacts of the built environment. The built environment is the human made surroundings including buildings and transportation systems that form neighborhoods that form the urban system. It is the largest consumer of energy and producer of Green House Gases.

Triple Bottom Line: Social, Environmental and Economic benefits of Green buildings are also known to as the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), Green building evaluation is based on their impacts on People (Social benefits), Planet (Environmental benefits) and Profit (Economic benefits). LEED certified projects achieve these three goals of sustainability and is how we define a green building.


Social Benefits

- Better indoor environmental quality
- Healthier environment 
- No extra burdens on local infra-structure

Environmental Benefits

- Protect wild life 
- No air or water pollution 
- No extra waste production 
- Prevent natural resources depletion

Economic Benefits

- Lower operating and maintenance costs 
- Higher property value 
- Higher employee productivity 
- Lower life cycle costs

LEED standards and principles are governed by the U.S. Green Building Council. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization. It was formed in 1993 and based in Washington D.C. Members of USGBC include building owners and users; real estate developers; facility managers; architects, designers, engineers, general contractors, subcontractors; product and building system manufacturers; government agencies and nonprofits. They represent companies and organizations from across the building industry

LEED certification of projects- A project must earn a minimum number of points in a single rating system to achieve a certain level of certification. Buildings can be certified to one of the following levels:
- Certified, 40-49 points 
- Silver, 50-59 points 
- Gold, 60-79 points 
- Platinum, 80+ points



# Our Scorecard and Explainations for Zamorano Plant

Our team did a cursory evaluation of the LEED Scorecard based on AutoCAD drawings and what we knew about the plant. 



![image.png](attachment:image.png)


Under our evaluation, we said the Zamorano plant could reasonably obtain up to 47 points, above the 40 required for LEED certification.  18 of those points came in the category for optimizing energy use. Our plant doesn't use much energy to begin with, so not much optimization of energy usage needs to be done. 

Below our the explainations of our evaluations of the Zamorano Plant according to the LEED Scorecard Rubric



# Location and Transportation



LEED for Neighborhood Development Location – LTc1

The plant is located on the Universidad Zamorano in Zamorano, Honduras.  Being on campus, the building is located within walking distance of other university classes and building.  

Sensitive Land Protection – LTc2

Unsure.   Building is built on what used to be a basketball court? Does that count as a previously developed site? 

High Priority Site – LTc3

 No, Building not in historical district, brownfield remediation site, or prior designated site. 

Surrounding Density and Diverse Uses – LTc4

Yes, plant should count as both community use and education facility without other buildings of the same use within ½ mile. 

Access to Quality Transit – LTc5

Likely to get point for school specific option- (need to ensure that a certain percentage of students live within 1.5 miles of a functional entry. 

 Bicycle Facilities – LTc6

Would need to provide short-term and long-term parking for visitors. Providing Bike Rack should be adequate for 1 point.  Should be in a network of off-street bicycle paths or on-street bicycle lanes. 

Reduced Parking Footprint – LTc7

Maybe. Did not see parking lot in the CAD drawing?  Do we receive point if we have no parking lot at all? 
 
Green Vehicles – LTc8

Unlikely to fulfill requirements for credit.  Wouldn’t not be worth it to provide EV charging station.   Maybe buses meet prescribed emission standards and all other school-owned vehicles are green.
 



# Sustainable Sites

1) Construction Activity Pollution Prevention – SSp1 (prerequisite)

-The project team must develop and implement an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan (ESC) to reduce construction pollution; the ESC plan must comply with the 2012 EPA General Construction Permit or local codes, whichever is more stringent.

Construction Activity pollution is not an issue (no heavy industrial equipment was used).  Plant construction was powered by rice and beans. 


2) Site Assessment – SSc1 

No.  The plant is not restoring 30% of developed land with native/adaptive vegetation. 



3) Site Development: Maximize Open Space – SSc3

Likely No. 30% must be open space.  The roof is not suitable for a green roof. 

4) Rainwater Management – SSc4
Likely No. Not aware of any rainwater management technologies 

5) Heat Island Reduction – SSc5
Likely No.  Solar reflective index of Aluzinc roofing is probably high. 

6) Light Pollution Reduction – SSc6
Yes. Plant will not be source of light pollution. 



# Water Efficiency



1) Outdoor Water Use Reduction – WEp1 + WEc1

Yes. Prerequisite and credit should be satisfied. No extensive use of water for outdoor irrigation. 

2) Indoor Water Use Reduction – WEp2 + WEc2

Yes. Indoor water use is limited to one bathroom. 


3) Water Metering – Building Level (WEp3) / Submetering (WEc4)

No water meter currently measuring water usage. We need to evaluate if water metering is worth installing to redeeming of this credit.  

There is an LFOM measuring flow of raw water into the plant.  



# Energy and Atmosphere



1)	Some requirement(EAp): fundamental commissioning and verification, minimum energy performance, building-level energy metering, fundamental refrigerant management.

This prerequisite will be fulfilled. There is is metering for electrical and water use, and 

2)	EAc1 enhanced commissioning (3+4 points):

Yes. The plant will use a minimal amount of electrical energy. 

3)	EAc2 optimize energy performance (18 points)

Yes. Our plant has energy metering, though there will be a low demand and usage of energy.  

4)	(prereq): Fundamental Refrigerant Management

Yes. Plant unlikely to have refrigerator. 

5)	(6): Enhanced Commissioning

No. It is similar to the fundamental commissioning but more restrict, since the plant is still in built, it is not realized now but it is quite easy and do not need to much work.

6)	(18): Optimize Energy Performance

Yes. Based on the low usage and demand of the plant, several credits can be gained.

7)	(1): Advanced Energy Metering
No.  This credit would require more advanced metering machine

8)	(2): Demand Response
No. The is only using electricity for light- there does not need to be a demand response for such low electricity usage. 

9)	(3): Renewable Energy Production

No, we are not producing any renewable energy on Site. 

10)	(1): Enhanced Refrigerant Management

Yes. No refrigerant system, so no management needed. 

11)	(2): Green Power and Carbon Offsets

No , we are currently not purchasing any Carbon Offsets. They wouldn't unlikely be within the scope of the project. 


# Materials and Resources


Materials and Resources
1)	(prereq): Storage and Collection of Recyclables

Unsure. Depends on University collection of recyclables.

2)	(prereq): Construction and Demolition Waste Management Planning

No.  Construction has already undergone with hiring of LEED AP involved.  

3)	(5) Building Life-Cycle Impact Reduction.

Unsure. It is a new construction, the materials should be compared to baseline and consider the location valuation, it is should not be hard to realize.

4)	(2): Building Product Disclosure and Optimization - Environmental Product

Achievable but would neeed LEED AP involved. 

5)	(2): Building Product Disclosure and Optimization - Sourcing of Raw Materials

Achievable, althought building construction has already begun. Ensure the selected products have self-declared or third party verified corporate social responsibility reports,. And we need to calculate if at least one of the responsible extraction criteria below for at least 25%, by cost, of the total value of permanently installed building products in the project.

6)  (2): Building Product Disclosure and Optimization - Material Ingredients 

Unsure about optimal materials, but building construction has already begun. 

7)	(2): Construction and Demolition Waste Management 

No. Construction has undergone without LEED AP.



# Indoor Environmental Quality



1)	Some requirements: minimum indoor air quality, environmental tobacco smoke control, minimum acoustic performance.

2)	EQc1 enhanced indoor are quality strategies

No. The raw water that be treated in the plant may have some volatile gases such as NH3, and the chlorine using to disinfection may also emit some Cl2 in the plant, we need some data about this.

3)	EQc2 low emitting materials

The plant mainly use PVC pipe，and some base building materials, so it may have no emitting materials.

4)	EQc3 construction management plan

No, construction already undergone without LEED AP

5)	EQc4 indoor are quality assessment

No. No plans for air testing machine

6)	EQc5 thermal comfort

- No, Plant will not have air conditioning , so probably not achievable

7)	EQc6 interior light

- Unsure about lighting at plant. Not sure about lighting 

8)	EQc7 daylight
- Unsure. There are plenty windows for daylight, but we need use blinds to prevent direct sunlight from water in the plant. 

9)	EQc8 quality views

- Unsure.  It is mainly for the office where operators doing their work, so we need to know the position of the office and the surroundings. Definition of quality view is somewhat subjective. 



# Innovation in Design




LEED provides credits to projects which achieve exceptional performance in sustainability above the
requirements and out of the scope of the LEED Green Building Rating System.
There are no prerequisites for this category; projects can earn up to 6 points from the following credits:
•Innovation in Design (up to 5 points)
•LEED Accredited Professional (up to 1 point)

This is where our AguaClara plants shine and should receive 5 credits.  The water treatment plant doesn’t use any energy through use of many different clever technologies. 


# Regional Priorities

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Usgbc website lists these areas as regional priority credits.   Up to 4 points can be earned in this category. We can likely gain 3 additional credits from optimizing energy performance, site development, and outdoor water use reduction. 




# Recommendations for Improvement and Future works

After going through the LEED scorecard, we have several recommendations for improving the Zamorano AguaClara plant. 

Under Location and Transportation, LEED rewards 1 point for having a bike rack on the facility. It is an inexpensive upgrade and would encourage people using human powered transport to get to the plant. 

For indoor water use reduction, there is only one bathroom in the plant so there isn't too much indoor water usage.  We would recommend dual flush toilets and energy efficient sinks to reduce water usage as much as possible. 

Under the energy and atmosphere, the plant has no plans for generate rate renewable energy.  We think that since we are close to a flow of surface water, we can use that water flow to possibly energy through small scale hydroelectric power. 


Besides reducing carbon emissions, LEED also puts an emphasis on indoor air quality and building comfort. 

In keeping in mind indoor air quality- we should look into another solutions for the storage of chlorine, which is currently planned to stored on the balcony. Chrloine affect indoor air quality and has the potential to corrode pipes. Perhaps in future plant designs, a designated room for chlorine would be designed. 

Thermal comfort is also a LEED category we are unlikely to fulfill, but can seek to improve from.  Currently their are no plans for air conditioning but perhaps a low energy fan cooling system could be implemented. 

Lastly daylight is a consideration for human confort.  Sunlight is good for people, but harmful to our water treatment process.  Currently the use of blinds are planned to block sunlight that would hit the water, but perhaps a strategic use of blinds will allow for sunlight for other areas of the building. 



# Another Option: The Living Buiding Challenge


Although LEED doesn't fit into the scope of our project, there may be other options. 

Another building certification system focuses on buildings that are not just more efficient, but are actually sustainable or have positive regenerative aspects.

Where LEED focuses on reducing the negative environmental impact of buildings- often in urban settings, the Living Building Challenge rewards certification to buildings to carbon neutral (or better) buildings.

With 331 Living Building Challenge project and growing, it is a certification worth looking forward to in the future.
