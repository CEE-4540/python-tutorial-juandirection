    "AguaClara has been designing and building water treatment plants since 2005 in Honduras, 2013 in India, and 2017 in Nicaragua. It has been providing gravity powered water treatment systems to thousands of people in rural communities. However, there were populations that could not be targeted due to the technology only being scaled up from 6 L/s. For towns and rural areas with populations with smaller needs, AguaClara technologies were out of their reach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently a one liter per second (1 LPS) plant was developed based on traditional AguaClara technology, to bring sustainable water treatment to towns with populations of 300 people per plant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first 1 LPS plant fabricated was sent to Cuatro Comunidades in Honduras, where a built in place plant already exists, and is currently operating without the filter attachment, also known as Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter (EStaRS). EStaRS is the last step in the 1 LPS plant processes before chlorination and completes the 4 step water treatment process: flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination.\n",
    "Having water treatment plants for smaller flow rates would increase AguaClara’s reach and allow it to help more people. Despite being in its initial stages, the demand for this technology is increasing. Three 1 LPS plants were recently ordered for a town that did not have water treatment. However, the implementation of 1 LPS plants is a problem that has not yet been solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project has stemmed from the possibility of implementing AguaClara technologies to be helpful in Puerto Rico’s post hurricane rebuild effort. The goal of this project is to assess whether the portable 1 L/s plant could be a viable option to help rural communities have safe drinking water. The project models multiple 1 L/s plants working in parallel to provide for the community and plans for the future when communities would need to add capacity. For this project, the team has set 6 L/s as the design constraint. We need experience building and deploying 1 LPS plants to determine the economics and ease of operation to compare to those of built in place plants. For example, if we need 12 L/s, it could still be reasonable to use the 1 LPS plants in parallel or select a 16 L/s built in place plant if more than 12 L/s is needed. Because the dividing line between the modular prefabricated 1 LPS plants and the build in place plants is unknown, the team chose 6 L/s because it is the smallest built in place plant capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is based on the following: \n",
    "* Standardization modular designs for each plant (1 plant has one EStaRs and Flocculator)\n",
    "* One entrance tank and chemical dosing controller\n",
    "* Entrance Tank accomodates to 6 L/s flow\n",
    "* Coagulant/ Chlorine dosing according to flow by operator\n",
    "* Parallel Layout for convenience \n",
    "* Extendable shelter walls to add capacity using chain-link fencing \n",
    "* Manifolds connecting up to 3 plants (accounting for 3 L/s) from the sedimentation tank to the ESTaRS and after filtration for chlorination (using Ts and fernco caps)\n",
    "* Manifolds to prevent flow to other filters being cut off if filters need to be backwashed and lacks enough flow \n",
    "* Equal flow to the filters and chlorination from the manifolds\n",
