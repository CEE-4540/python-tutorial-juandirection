## H2Flows members:  Mehrin Selimgir, Linping Xu, Shuo Han



## Introduction

In this design, our goal is to create a four channel design algorithms for AguaClara sedimentation tank in Python.
 
An AguaClara channel design algorithm has already been created on MathCAD. Thus, the primary basis of our design approach is based on this original MathCAD code as well as coding tools in aide_design package. For the benefit of future design work of AguaClara team, this project is to create a model that could quickly respond to the change of design parameters like flow rate, the size of the sedimentation tanks and filter tanks etc, but also could guarantee the treatment performance at the same time.

The following image is the planview of the sedimentation tank and its inlet and out channels:

Figure 3 elucidates the four channels we are designing in our project. The effluent from flocculation tank comes in from the left side of inlet channel pre weir, and goes into the manifolds through the pipe shown in Figure 3. Inlet channel post weir is used to drain the poorly flocculated water when flocculation is not performing well. Exit channel pre weir is to collect the clean water from the exit launder, and effluent water overflow into post weir to get collected.






## Design Constraints:
* Varying Flow rates [6,60] L/s

* Velocity constraints for inlet channel:
    - Ensure flocs donâ€™t drop (0.15m/s), this would be our lower bound of velocity design, Vmin
    - Distribute the water uniformly - This would be our higher bound of velocity design, Vmax



## Governing Constraints of the Four Channels
* The width of the inlet channel pre weir is constrained by the maximum inlet channel headloss and flow condition.
* The width of the inlet channel post weir is constrained by the headloss (Pressure Recovery) and the minimum channel width that is predefined(15cm).
* The width of the exit channel pre weir is constrained by the minimum channel width that is predefined (15 cm).
* The width of the exit channel post weir is constrained by the headloss and the minimum width that is predefined (15 cm).

## Conclusion
We want to look into how the total width of the four channels will change when increasing the flow rate, our goal is to evaluate the effect of future flow rate increase on current drinking water design. In real engineering design, especially for the global South, it is critical to take cost into consideration. Ideally our design should be able to handle future flow rate as high as 60 L/s, but if the construction cost is too high, the design might not be feasible for local people. We assume that the cost of construction is proportional to the total width, and the results of our codes from different flow rate are as follows:

( Following results are based on assumption of legitimate number of sedimentation tanks with other input variables remain all the same.)

| Flow Rate (L/s) | Number of Sed Tanks | Total Width (cm)   |
|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------:|
|   24  | 4| 92.77|
|   36  | 6| 109.3|
|   60  | 6| 128.3|

The numbers above provide a rough idea about the scale of increase in total width, apparently, it doesn't go proportionally with the increase in flow rate. Thus, our suggestion for design team is that, it is feasible to appropriately increase the total width within the financial ability to accommodate future demand. However, more accurate calculation should be done using different sets of real expert inputs.



# Step 1: Design of Inlet Channel

## 1.1 The length of the sedimentation tank channel



```python
L_SedChannel=N_SedTanks*W_Sed+T_SedWall+(N_SedTanks-1)*T_SedDividingWall
py2tex('L_SedChannel=N_SedTanks*W_Sed+T_SedWall+(N_SedTanks-1)*T_SedDividingWall')
print('The length of the sedimentation tank channel is ',L_SedChannel.to(u.m))
```


$$L_{SedChannel}=N_{SedTanks}\,W_{Sed}+T_{SedWall}+\left(N_{SedTanks}-1\right)\,T_{SedDividingWall}$$


    $$L_{SedChannel}=N_{SedTanks}\,W_{Sed}+T_{SedWall}+\left(N_{SedTanks}-1\right)\,T_{SedDividingWall}$$
    The length of the sedimentation tank channel is  4.867 meter
    

## 1.2 The headloss of exit channel pre weir



```python
# Headloss of the sedimentation tank weir exit
# Old MathCAD code: HL_SedWeirExit=Headloss_weir(Q_Train,L_SedChannel)
# This function is defined in physchem functions as "pc.headloss_weir"
HL_SedWeirExit=pc.headloss_weir(Q_Plant, L_SedChannel)
print('The headloss of the exit channel pre weir is ',HL_SedWeirExit.to(u.cm))
```

    The headloss of the exit channel pre weir is  1.936 centimeter
    

## 1.3 The maximum headloss of the inlet channels



```python
# The maximum headloss of the inlet channel
HL_SedInletChannelMax=(HL_SedLaunderBod+HL_SedDiffuser)*(1-Pi_QSedTanks**2)
py2tex('HL_SedInletChannelMax=(HL_SedLaunderBod+HL_SedDiffuser)*(1-Pi_QSedTanks**2)')
print('The maximum headloss of the inlet channel is ',HL_SedInletChannelMax)
```


$$HL_{SedInletChannelMax}=\left(HL_{SedLaunderBod}+HL_{SedDiffuser}\right)\,\left(1-\Pi_{QSedTanks}^{2}\right)$$


    $$HL_{SedInletChannelMax}=\left(HL_{SedLaunderBod}+HL_{SedDiffuser}\right)\,\left(1-\Pi_{QSedTanks}^{2}\right)$$
    The maximum headloss of the inlet channel is  0.3998 centimeter
    

## 1.4 The minimum width of inlet channel pre weir via plumbing 



```python
# Width of the Inlet Channel Sedimentation Tank Weir calculated based on "plumbing"- 
# Minimum value of the width of the Weir so that the manifold may fit in
# Note variable name change here
Min_W_SedInletChannelWeir= pipe.OD(ND_SedManifold)+2*S_Fitting

print('The minimum width of the inlet channel pre weir via plumbing is ',Min_W_SedInletChannelWeir.to(u.cm))

```

    The minimum width of the inlet channel pre weir via plumbing is  13.34 centimeter
    

## 1.5 The minimum width of the inlet channel pre weir via headloss


The original MathCAD equation for calculating the width of the weir for inlet channel calculated using headloss is as follow:

**W_SedInletChannelPreWeirMinHL = W_HorizChannel(Q_Plant, HW_SedInletChannelMax, HL_SedInletChannelMax, L_SedChannel,Nu_Water, E_concrete,0 ,0)**

Here in this funtction, we compare the maximum head loss in inlet channel (HL_SedInletChannelMax) and 1/3 height of water in inlet channel (1/3 HW_SedInletChannelMax) and take the smaller value as the headloss for calculation of the channel width. 1/3 HW_SedInletChannelMax is derived from the calculation of critical flow, using Froude number, we get to the conclusion that ciritical depth y = 2/3 HW_SedInletChannelMax, which means delta H = 1/3 HW_SedInletChannelMax. Such constraint is aiming at making sure the flow in inlet channel is stable.

The next step is to use loop to find the right answer for channel width. The equation is showed below.


```python
def W_HorizChannel(Q_Plant,HW_SedInletChannelMax,HL_SedInletChannelMax,L_SedChannel,Nu_Water, E_concrete,manifold,K):
    # Delta H
    HL_Local=min(HL_SedInletChannelMax,1/3*HW_SedInletChannelMax)
    W_new=Q_Plant/((HW_SedInletChannelMax-HL_Local)*np.sqrt(2*pc.gravity*HL_Local))
    error=1
    i=0
    while error>0.0001 and i<20:
        W=W_new
        i=i+1
        term1=pc.fric_rect(Q_Plant, W, HW_SedInletChannelMax-HL_Local,Nu_Water, E_concrete, openchannel)
        term2=L_SedChannel/(4*pc.radius_hydraulic(W,HW_SedInletChannelMax-HL_Local,openchannel))*(1-2*manifold/3)
        term3=2*pc.gravity*HL_Local
        term4=Q_Plant/(HW_SedInletChannelMax-HL_Local)
        W_new=np.sqrt((1+K+term1*term2)/term3)*term4
        error=np.abs(W_new-W)/(W_new-W)
    return W_new
py2tex('W = Q/(H-DeltaH)- sqrt((1+f*(L/4*R_h))/2*g*(DeltaH))')


# Minimum width calculated based on headloss
Nu_Water = pc.viscosity_kinematic(T_design)
Min_W_SedInletChannelPreWeirHL = (W_HorizChannel(Q_Plant,HW_SedInletChannelMax,HL_SedInletChannelMax,L_SedChannel,Nu_Water, E_Concrete,0,0)).to(u.inch)

print('The minimum widthof the inlet channel pre weir via headloss is ',Min_W_SedInletChannelPreWeirHL.to(u.cm))



```


$$W=\frac{Q}{H-\Delta H}-\sqrt{\frac{1+f\,\frac{L}{4}\,R_{h}}{2}\,g\,\Delta H}$$


    $$W=\frac{Q}{H-\Delta H}-\sqrt{\frac{1+f\,\frac{L}{4}\,R_{h}}{2}\,g\,\Delta H}$$
    The minimum widthof the inlet channel pre weir via headloss is  22.34 centimeter
    

## 1.6 The width of the inlet channel pre weir


```python
#Now taking the maximum value of the width

W_SedInletChannelPreWeir = max(Min_W_SedInletChannelWeir, Min_W_SedInletChannelPreWeirHL)

    error=1
    i=0
    while error>0.001 and i<200:
        H=H_new
        HL_local=min(HL_SedInletChannelMax,1/3*H_new)
        i=i+1
        term1=Q_Plant/W_SedInletChannelPreWeir
        term2=pc.fric_rect(Q_Plant,W_SedInletChannelPreWeir , H-HL_local,Nu_Water, E_Concrete, openchannel)
