    "In order to grow as quickly as possible, AguaClara has focused on building tools to help future designs of plants. These tools will automatically generate schematics of entire water filtration plants that adjust with given dimensions associated with a specific location. In order to improve the automated design process of AguaClara, the team began to transition away from old and outdated softwares, such as MathCAD, in the summer of 2017. One of the new softwares that Automated Infrastructure Design Engine (AIDE) will rely heavily on is Fusion 360, a program that AguaClara has no previous experience with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this team is to build a working, parameterized model of a sample sedimentation tank that may serve as a module for an entire plant's design to reference and manipulate accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first focus of the team was on the body of the sedimentation tank, as opposed to the channels on the outside. This is because these channels stretch across multiple tanks and are to be created as a separate template. This plant should be as detailed as possible and possess all functional components of a real sedimentation tank. These components should be able to change given an input of parameters and still work within an acceptable range of values. Fusion 360 is able to provide this flexibility."

Each member had to learn how to utilize Fusion 360 before the team could break out and model different parts of the sedimentation tank. This was accomplished through Ethan's AIDE tutorial on drawing AIDE templates and individual practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In between practising Fusion at home, the team works on figuring out the necessary dimensions needed to construct the first iteration of the 3D model. Fletcher has provided the team with AIDE's list of parameters that they have been basing their initial drawings on. This acts as a starting point for the team's build.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team's general approach to the project was to develop a working model of the sedimentation tank in Fusion 360 to have visual context of the important geometry variables to be defined by either a user input or to be derived through an equation. From there, the team worked to complete a full glossary of parameters and equations that will be used to construct the full sedimentation tank. The team hopes to construct both a modular and a scalable sedimentation tank that may be used in a variety of plant sizes."

Once a working model was made, the estimated values were corrected through alignment with Aide Design's variable definitions relevant to the 20 L/s flow rate. Many variables are consitituently dependent upon user inputs and other equations that cascade through variable definitions. In a way, the 20 L/s values provide a sort of sanity check as we continue to develop the parametrized model.\n",

    "The plate settlers are not individually placed and standalone, but rather produced in pre-set modules held together by spacers and internal piping.

    "### Use of AutoCAD\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensions for building a sedimentation have already been calculated and used to design models built into AutoCAD. The team intends on using these files' dimensions to ensure that the dimensions for the Fusion 360 model will be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to note is that there already exists a Fusion 360 CADed model for a sedimentation tank with detailed piping, plate settlers, depths, diameters, widths, and so on. However, the model was imported directly from its original AutoCAD file and is composed of a conglomeration of bodies specifically placed in their respective positions in order to represent the overall sedimentation tank. Although the components are to scale, none of them are in communication with eachother and therefore the model cannot simply be \"scaled up\" to size. Fusion 360 will serve to recreate this design, but by creating a smart model where items are in conversation with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from guiding the team in component proximity and location, the AutoCAD model helps the team determine the ratios of item placement for components not necessarily requiring iteration. For example, the pipes that connect plate settlers into a plate settler module are inserted at a region of the plate settler relative to the length. By analyzing the distances on the \"dummy\" Fusion model, an appropriate ratio may be applied to any plate settler module for any given capture velocity and upflow velocity. Measurements where this is not applicable include optimal holes for the inlet manifold or the number of plates that will fit in a sedimentation tank.\n",

    "The team can incorporate variables into a working Fusion model once they have established a consistent basis for variable naming. This Fusion model will provide more utility than the current AutoCAD models; they have assemblies that reference other parts and are not purely placed by location with no regard to components surrounding it. The most important part of these Fusion models is keeping everything referenced to as few variables as possible. Just as previously stated, when finishing equations for parameters everything about the 3D model should be defined by what is put into it. For example, this can be seen in the plan view of the concrete tank of the sedimentation tank.\n",

So the width of the sketched rectangle is determined by the equation (SedTank_ActiveLength + 2 * SedTank_ThicknessDividingWall). Some other driven dimensions are determined by geometric properties. The channel in the middle that houses the jet reverser is one of these cases, where it moves position based on where the center line is.\n",

    "\n",
    "Building a parameterized model without being able to read parameters is a big challenge that we will have to continually think about when starting the first few sketches. It is possible that we will have to redo some of our work if it is discovered that geometry needs to be defined in a more relationed manner rather than hard coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major challenge to be addressed in this design are inconsistencies in naming conventions for system variables. This has made the transition from AIDE Design's parameter definitions into Fusion 360 a difficult matter. Communication with the Aide team has helped with these uncertainties. For future parameter glossaries, extensive variable descriptions in a note column would likely bring tremendous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlet manifold and overall height of the sedimentation tank have presented the most difficulty in parametrization of the model. The AguaClara literature on Confluence does not have explicit descriptors or sometimes lacks clarity on certain variables (lack of image) to address all aspects of the component's geometry. This includes water level height, plant freeboard, outlet manifold headloss, etc. Since the 4540 cirriculum does not put emphasis on the design of the outlet manifold and ultimate sedimentation tank height, understanding the relationships between upflow velocity, tank flow rate, and the desired intake rate of each hole in the outlet manifold is key to reducing user entered values. The team hopes to define these variables soon once they get in contact with Ethan and the AIDE team. Primary objectives in parameterization are first to define all relevant parameters while simultaneously bridging the gaps of information between teams to build a unified glossary of parameters.\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project the team learned many aspects about the process of building a fully parameterized model. So many components inside the sedimentation tank must move or adjust depending on the change of single variable. This fact makes it difficult to reliably update such a complex system. However, through lots of iteration the current sedimentation tank assembly is ultimately able to handle a wide array of user inputs without rebuilding an entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This advancement in flexibility should significantly improve future experiences of AIDE users and designers. Without the hassle of individually placing components into the appropriate x, y, and z locations, engineers can more easily modify subcomponents of the larger system. They will be able to freely change lengths, widths, or diameters without worrying about redefining locations of many different, mostly unrelated objects.\n"

    "# Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Future iterations of equations will still need to focus on the outlet manifold and length of sedimentation tank. The use of plate settler modules makes this dimension difficult to find and will need something more complicated than simple patterning. In addition to modfying some exisiting equations future teams will have to add more elements of the sedimentationt tank. This includes the floc hopper, piping, and entrance channel. The entrace channel is another interersting challenge becuase it must connect several copies of the same sedimentation tank."

    "I'd suggest building a simple drawing that includes the ability to scale and reviewing that with Ethan before even beginning to draw the sedimentation tank.You want to make sure that you understand the important steps in defining the sedimentation tank template drawing before you begin creating it because it is possible that the parametric scaling will require particular approach to creating the template."

    "We  agree that keeping in mind the idea that all the dimensions may have to be formatted in a specific manner is important. It is much better to do this early on if we discover that every dimension will have to be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if some dimensions will have to be changed later for global to user, we believe the parametric scaling will be fairly easy to implement because many features of the sedimentation tank are consistent throughout the various plant sizes. This means that many of the dimensions can be hard coded and will not need to be variable."
