## **Introduction** 
Suriqui is an island community on the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca that requires a system for water supply and treatment.  Currently, the area has no reliable method of water treatment and distribution. For this reason, potential water treatment/distribution systems are being identified. The communities often rely on expensive bottled water, so this project is important to ensure that the communities have access to cheap, safe drinking water. Included below is a map of the island of Siriqui, and its four villages: Paco Chachacoma, Cayumpaya, Supicachi, and Suriqui (composed of four smaller villages, Ayjadero, Rosani, Yawirjani, and Yumani).  Populations are centered in three areas (the dashed line areas): Siriqui, Northwest, South Central.  These three population centers can either be connected by a single system, or served by three separate individual systems for each local community.  This report outlines a treatment plan for three separate systems in: Siriqui, the Northwest, and the South Central population centers.  The report focuses on a treatment plan for the largest community, Siriqui, which makes up approximately 60% of the population.

## **Chosen Design**
After considering the information available, the chosen design is to provide an indoor treatment plant only for the population center of Suriqui.  This plant will be composed of either 4, 8, or 11 separate 1 L/s prefabricated water treatment systems.  With the different flow rates, it will require the operator to work either 24, 12, or 8 hours each day respectively as there will be a storage tank to collect the excess water.

This area also has a working distribution network [1]. Electricity access to this area is not ideal as during thunderstorms the population center experiences power blackouts [2].  Because of this, the water pumps used will be run on diesel in order to avoid plant shutdown during thunderstorms.  The island would rather use lake water than well water [2], for this reason, the inlet pipe will draw water in from the lake. The water will be drawn from the lake via a diesel pump.



## **Problem Identification:** 
Is it cheaper to construct three separate small water treatment plants in the respective communities or construct one large one that is accompanied by a distribution system for the entire island?  Additionally, what sort of design specifications are most beneficial to the community? Is it better to run a treatment plant for 24 hours a day or for 12 or 8 hours a day with a storage tank? Decisions regarding design specifications include:  (1) location of plant, (2) water source and size of inlet pipe (lake, spring, or well water),  (3) hours of plant operation, (4) type of pump, (5) source of electrical power for pump (power grid or diesel pump), (6) presence of water meters in homes 

## **Problem Solution:** 
We will identify the costs relating to the construction of separate water treatment systems accounting for the decisions specified above, as well as the feasibility of properly delivering safe drinking water throughout the island.   


## **Important Constraints:**

The important constraints are to minimize cost, maintenance, and space.  To minimize costs, we have developed a design that favors upfront costs that ideally can be covered by a fund rather than later costs to be paid by taxpayers on the island.  Additionally, we will try to minimize primarily the distance the water must be pumped, and secondarily the distance between the plants and the community.  The treatment system must be capable of handling the necessary flow rates for the island.  For the village of Siriqui, the required flow rate is 3.7 L/s.  The plant must be simple to construct and easy to operate. It may also be advantageous to limit the responsibilities of the plant operator as plant operators will be expensive. This is achieved by using AguaClara prefabricated 1 L/s plants.  


## **Trade-offs:**
There are some important tradeoffs to consider for this project. For instance, the more complicated the design is the more difficult it will be to find a competent operator. Also, the more flow required the larger the plant must be. For the single plant design, only one plant must be constructed but there will need to be many utility lines. However, for the multi plant design, several plants will need to be constructed, but there will need to be fewer connecting utility lines.  Some of the communities on the island already have distribution networks; the Siriqui community's distribution is functional and transports water to every house [5]. Another trade-off we will be considering is the trade-off between upfront and annual costs, particularly in regards to running the plant for 24 vs. 12 vs. 8 hours a day.


## **Perceived operator/user specifications:**

The specifications of the plant are that the qualified operator(s) should be literate and capable of reading a linear flow orifice meter.  In addition, the operator should be able to use mass conservation in order to calculate coagulant and chlorine dosage based on plant and chemical flow measurements.

## **Major design alternatives:**

Our group is focusing on a design consisting of several different pre-fabricated plants, while our cohorts are considering a single civil work system.  The following design alternatives are:

1. **Location of plant:** Plant must be located higher than the community.  The horizontal and vertical distances between the lake and the plant (pumping distance) should be minimized to reduce energy required for pumping.  

2. **Water source and size of inlet pipe.**  Possible water sources include:
    1. Siriqui Spring & Storage Tank (only operational during rainy season, flow is unknown, water quality data available)
    2. Siriqui Well (flow unknown, no water quality data available)
    3. Lake (water quality data available for other sides of island, none for Siriqui side).
    
3. **Hours of plant operation and associated number of plants/storage tanks:** 
    1. 24 hours/day with 4 plants and no storage tank
    2. 12 hours/day with 8 plants and storage tank
    3. 8 hours/day with 11 plants and storage tank
    
4. **Type of pump:** Pump must be able to deliver the necessary amount of water.

5. **Source of power for pump:**
    1. Electrical grid on island
    2. Diesel-powered pump
    
6. **Water meters**
    1. No water meters (households pay a flat rate for water, but upfront cost for meters and installation)
    2. Water meters (households pay for the amount of water they use, typically saves money)

## **Comparison of the major design alternatives:**


Our prefabricated design will consist of several plants while our cohorts will design one civil work plant.The pre-fabricated plan consists of 4, 8 or 11 plants that each can handle smaller flow rates whereas the single system would have to be large enough to handle the combined flow rate. This decision will have to be based on the trade off in cost of a single plant and many utility connections versus the cost of several smaller plants and much fewer utility connections. Having more smaller plants also has the advantage of still producing water in other parts of the island if one of the plants were to fail. The design decision will also be based on the trade-off of annual and upfront costs associated with running the plants for 8, 12 or 24 hours a day.

1. **Location of plant:** 
Many locations can be considered.  Two notable options considered are the high elevations on the Ayhadero and Yumani/Yawirjani peninsulas.

2. **Water source and size of inlet pipe.**  
The lake is deemed to be most feasible water source, as the flows of the spring and well are probably not sufficient to provide water to the entire community.  A combination of the sources was considered, but would require additional pumps, which would be expensive and require maintenance.
    
3. **Hours of plant operation and associated number of plants/storage tanks:** 
The three options (8, 12, and 24 hour operation) are considered and costs are analyzed below.  Having more than 4 plants would increase upfront costs while decreasing operator costs which would likely have to be paid for by the island inhabitants. 
    
4. **Type of pump:** 
Many pump options can be considered. 

5. **Source of power for pump:**
A diesel-powered pump was deemed to be the only option, as electricity is very unreliable on the island.  In addition, diesel is likely already being delivered to the island to run the island's power plant.
    
6. **Water meters**
Water meters represent an upfront cost, but would likely conserve water and costs.



## **Methods**

After consultation with the other group, this group will be working on multiple 1L/s plants as the other group works on a single plant to handle the entire island.  From further inspection, the island is broken up into three distinct population centers rather than 4 arbitrary villages.  To adjust the table from from the prompt, the population centers are broken down as follows:

### Part 1: Location of Plant

Plant must be located 5-10 meters (17-33 ft) higher than the community, whose maximum elevation is 3862 m (12,670 ft).  The horizontal and vertical distances between the lake and the plant (pumping distance) should be minimized to reduce energy required for pumping. A suitable area where the plant could be located is provided below:

### Part 2: Water Source

Water Quality was assessed in 3 locations: (1) Supicachi Well and (2) Lake (both on Northwest side of island), as well as (3) Lake on South Central side of island (Cuyampaya).  The following are data that exceeded Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)[6]:
* (1) Supicachi Well: Total Coliforms, Iron
* (2) Lake, Northwest: Boron, Total Hardness, Sulfates, Chloride, Dissolved Solids, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium
* (3) Lake, Central South: Boron, Total Hardness, Sulfates, Chloride, Dissolved Solids, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Total Coliforms
* (4) Suriqui Spring Storage Tank: Total Coliforms
* Typical influent temperature is probably around 10 degrees C (50 deg F) 

Water quality was not assessed in the Siriqui Well nor the lake near Siriqui.

The lake is deemed to be most feasible water source, as the flows of the spring and well are unknown but likely not sufficient to provide water to the entire community. 

Water could be taken from either sides of the mountain on which the plant is located.  A rough estimate would be ~300 m (1,000 ft) of 10 cm (4 inch) PVC pipe needed to tranport water from the lake to the plant. 4 inch PVC pipe is estimated to cost [$32 per 10 feet](http://pvcpipesupplies.com/4-x-10-schedule-40-pvc-pipe-h0400400pw1000.html).

The minimum wage in Bolivia is [2,000 BOB per month](https://tradingeconomics.com/bolivia/minimum-wages)
, with a 48 hour work week.


    


```python
# Part 2 Calculations

#Minimum wage is 2000BOB/month with 48hours/week
# equivalent to working 6 8-hour days, with 4 week months
min_wage_BOB_monthly = 2000
BOB_to_USD = 0.15*(u.USD)
min_wage_USD_hourly =(BOB_to_USD*(min_wage_BOB_monthly/(6*4*8)))*(1/u.hour)


# Cost of PVC from water to plants (estimated as a distance of 1,000 ft)
cost_unitpvc = (32*u.USD)/(10*u.ft)
length_pvc = 1000*u.ft
cost_pvc = cost_unitpvc*length_pvc
people_install_pvc = 3
hours_install_pvc = 8*u.hr
cost_install_pvc = people_install_pvc*hours_install_pvc*min_wage_USD_hourly
total_cost_pvc = cost_pvc+cost_install_pvc 

print('The total cost of 300 m of PVC pipe + installation is ', total_cost_pvc)
#________________________________________________________

total_upfront_24hr_pt2 = total_cost_pvc
total_upfront_12hr_pt2 = total_cost_pvc
total_upfront_8hr_pt2 = total_cost_pvc



```

    The total cost of 300 m of PVC pipe + installation is  3238 dollar
    

**Summary of PVC costs**

| Hours of Operation per day | Upfront Cost for PVC     |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|             24             |          3,238           |
|             12             |          3,238           |
|              8             |          3,238           |




### Part 3: Hours of Plant Operation & Resulting Number of Plants + Storage Tank

Hours of plant operation is an important consideration.  We decided it is better to have more plants running for less hours of the day, to maximize upfront costs instead of operator costs.  

The total upfront costs for the plants are:

(1) Cost to construct the plant in Honduras (materials + labor):
    The minimum wage in Honduras is [22.44 lempiras per hour](https://www.minimum-wage.org/international/honduras) and the cost of materials for 1 plant is $2625.91 [3].
    
(2) Cost to install the plant in Bolivia (labor)

(3) Cost of storage tank (size depends on hours of operation):
    1 10,000 Gallon tank (38,000 L) costs [$5,7000](http://www.tank-depot.com/productdetails.aspx?part=N-43132&gclid=CjwKCAiA07PRBRBJEiwAS20SIINWrL9c-LK240sf2qekm1QLi6bsDOp3gqP38kmpAFIL073Z6MbZDxoCCrEQAvD_BwE)

(4) Cost of concrete buildings to house plants: concrete costs [$9-12 per square foot](https://concrete.promatcher.com/cost/)
    
The total annual costs for the plants include the cost to employ an operator.

### Part 4: Pump

We considered the following types of pumps [3]:

**Above Ground Pump (Primed)**
    
Pros:
    
   * Easy to maintain
   * Longer lifespan than submersed pump (~20 years)
    
Cons:
    
   * Has to be primed
    
**Submerged Pump**
    
Pros:
    
   * Doesn’t need to be primed
   * Lower capital cost
    
Cons:
    
   * Difficult to remove
   * Shorter lifespan than primed pump (~5 years)
    
**Pump in Pit Below Water Level**
    
Pros:
    
   * Can use submersible or non continuously submersible pump
    
Cons:
    
   * Have to dig a pit
   * If a non-submersible pump is used another pump is needed to pump water out of pit in case of rain 

We decided to choose a primed above ground pump for its long lifespan and easy maintenance.

A typical primed above ground pump can be found [here.](http://www.firepenny.com/CET_10hp_Hartz_Diesel_Fire_Pump_p/pfp-10hp-dsl.htm)  This pump costs $6,950.

Pump maintenance includes replacement of the diesel motor every ~5 years.  A diesel motor costs around [$400.](https://www.kohler-engine-parts.opeengines.com/-p-52259?gclid=CjwKCAiA07PRBRBJEiwAS20SIDhASoCaha0vulNSSrpNBwKwcogAVqRcKT59my-5o04PPBNSiBKJixoC08EQAvD_BwE)

The pump will be at about 3830 m (12566 ft) above sea level (the elevation of Lake Titicaca), non submerged.  It will then have to pump up approximately 18.3 m (60 ft) to the plant, which is well within the capabilities of the pump.





```python
# Part 4 Calculations
flow = 11*(u.L/u.s) #The highest flow possible if the pump was only running for 8 hours/day
maxheighttopump = 60*u.ft #elevation difference between pump and plant

cost_pump = 6950*u.USD

from aide_design import pipedatabase as pipe
temp = 10*u.degC
nu=pc.viscosity_kinematic(temp)
lengthpvc = 1000*u.ft
minorlosscoefsums = 2 #high estimate
pvcroughness = 0.0015*u.mm
nominaldiam = 4*u.inch
SDR=26
diam = pipe.ID_SDR(nominaldiam,SDR)
#headloss(FlowRate, Diam, Length, Nu, PipeRough, KMinor)
headloss = pc.headloss(flow,diam,lengthpvc, nu,pvcroughness,minorlosscoefsums)

totalhead = headloss + maxheighttopump

print('The design flow of ',flow, ' must be capable of being pumped at a head of ',totalhead,)
print('The pump in question is capable of providing a flow of 13L/s at a head of 24m.')
print('The pump is therefore capable of handling the design flow and head needed.')


# Pump maintenance
cost_diesel_motor = 400*u.USD
annual_cost_motor = cost_diesel_motor/5

print('Costs for the pump include ', cost_pump, 'upfront cost and ', annual_cost_motor, 'average annual cost for maintenance.')

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
total_upfront_24hr_pt4 = cost_pump
total_annual_24hr_pt4 = annual_cost_motor

total_upfront_12hr_pt4 = cost_pump
total_annual_12hr_pt4 = annual_cost_motor

total_upfront_8hr_pt4 = cost_pump
total_annual_8hr_pt4 = annual_cost_motor

```

    The design flow of  11 liter / second  must be capable of being pumped at a head of  22.62 meter
    The pump in question is capable of providing a flow of 13L/s at a head of 24m.
    The pump is therefore capable of handling the design flow and head needed.
    Costs for the pump include  6950 dollar upfront cost and  80 dollar average annual cost for maintenance.
    

**Summary of Pump Costs**


| Hours of Operation per day | Upfront Cost for pump    | Avg Annual Cost for pump maintenance    |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|             24             |          6,950           |          80                             |
|             12             |          6,950           |           80                            |
|              8             |          6,950           |           80                            |
 


### Part 5: Source of Power

Engineers in Action employees in addition to David Buck from CH2M Hill reported that electricity on the island was not consistent, and often failed during rain events [2].  Our decision is to use a diesel powered pump.  Diesel is likely already being delivered to the island to power its power plant. 

See fuel calculations below.


```python
# Part 5 Calculations

#Fuel
dieselcost = 0.53*u.USD/u.gal
fuelconsrate = 0.56*u.gal/u.hr
costoffuelyr_24hr = (dieselcost*fuelconsrate*365*u.day).to(u.USD) #24 hour days
costoffuelyr_12hr = (dieselcost*fuelconsrate*365*u.day*.5).to(u.USD) #12 hour days
costoffuelyr_8hr = (dieselcost*fuelconsrate*365*u.day*(1/3)).to(u.USD) #8 hour days
print('For one year: It will cost ',costoffuelyr_8hr,'to run the pump 8 hours a day, ',costoffuelyr_12hr,'to run the pump 12 hours a day, and ',costoffuelyr_24hr,'to run the pump 24 hours a day.')

total_annual_24hr_pt5 = costoffuelyr_24hr
total_annual_12hr_pt5 = costoffuelyr_12hr
total_annual_8hr_pt5 = costoffuelyr_8hr


```

    For one year: It will cost  866.7 dollar to run the pump 8 hours a day,  1300 dollar to run the pump 12 hours a day, and  2600 dollar to run the pump 24 hours a day.
    

**Summary of Fuel Costs**


| Hours of Operation per day | Annual Cost for Fuel     |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|             24             |          2,600           |
|             12             |          1,300           |
|              8             |            870           |
 

### Part 6: Water Meters

The costs of water meters was determined by estimating the number of houses in the Siriqui community and the cost of a typical water meter.  The number of houses in the community was estimated by counting the number of houses in an area that looked like it contained approximately 1/4 of the houses (80 houses) and multiplying that by 4 (320 houses total in Siruiqui community). 

Water meters typically cost around [$25](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/high-cost-of-smart-water-meters-keeps-adoption-rates-low/443905/).
For installation costs, we are estimating a [3 hour installation per house](https://www.southwestwater.co.uk/frequently-asked-questions/meters/how-long-will-it-take-to-install-a-meter/), since new units will need to be installed in each house.


```python
# Part 6 Calculations
# Number of meters was determined by counting the number of homes in 1/4 of the community area and multiplying by 4
num_houses = 80*4
cost_meter = 25*u.USD
cost_320_meters = num_houses*cost_meter

# Installation cost
time_install_meter = 3*u.hour
cost_install_320_meters = time_install_meter*num_houses*min_wage_USD_hourly

total_cost_meters = cost_320_meters + cost_install_320_meters

print('The total cost of the meters + installation would be ', total_cost_meters)
#_____________________________________________________________________________________________
total_upfront_24hr_pt6 = total_cost_meters
total_upfront_12hr_pt6 = total_cost_meters
total_upfront_8hr_pt6 = total_cost_meters
```

    The total cost of the meters + installation would be  9500 dollar
    

$9,500 represents a large upfront cost, but would save water and cut down on later costs for the villagers.

**Summary of Meter Costs**


| Hours of Operation per day | Upfront Cost for meters  |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|             24             |          9,500           |
|             12             |          9,500           |
|              8             |          9,500           |

 

### Part 7: Additional costs, Chlorine and Coagulant

We decided to use commercially available liquid bleach. Cost estimates were provided by Professor Monroe. We also used the coagulant dose provided in the Mechanical and Flocculation Model Design Challenge.


```python
FlowPlant = 4*u.L/u.s
StockCl2 = 51.4*(u.gram/u.L)
DoseCl2 = 2*(u.mg/u.L)
cost_bleach = 2*(u.USD/u.kg)
cost_coagulant = 2*(u.USD/u.kg)
cost_bleach_mL = cost_bleach*StockCl2

def TotalChemFlow(FlowPlant, MaxChemDose, MaxAllowStock):
    totchemflow = ((MaxChemDose*FlowPlant)/MaxAllowStock).to(u.L/u.s)
    
    return totchemflow

Total_bleach = TotalChemFlow(FlowPlant,DoseCl2,StockCl2).to(u.L/u.year)
cost_bleach_annual = (Total_bleach*cost_bleach_mL).to(u.USD/u.year)
print('The annual cost of bleach would be ',cost_bleach_annual)

Dose_coagulant = 1*(u.mg/u.L)
total_coagulant = (Dose_coagulant*FlowPlant)
cost_coagulant_annual = (total_coagulant*cost_coagulant).to(u.USD/u.year)
print('The annual cost of coagulant would be ',cost_coagulant_annual)
print('totaling ', cost_bleach_annual + cost_coagulant_annual)

#_____________________________________________
total_annual_24hr_pt7 = (cost_bleach_annual+cost_coagulant_annual)*u.year
total_annual_12hr_pt7 = (cost_bleach_annual+cost_coagulant_annual)*u.year
total_annual_8hr_pt7 = (cost_bleach_annual+cost_coagulant_annual)*u.year
```

    The annual cost of bleach would be  504.9 dollar / year
    The annual cost of coagulant would be  252.5 dollar / year
    totaling  757.4 dollar / year
    

### Summary of Chemical Costs

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we would recommend that 11 plants, operated for 8 hours a day, be constructed to service the residents of the Siriqui community.  We see 2 main benefits to the 8-hr a day scenario that will be most beneficial to the people of Siriqui.  First, an 8 hour workday is better than a 12 or 24 hour workday.  In the case of one shift per day, an 8 hour day is more ethical than a 12 hour day, and there would be no need to consider splitting the day into multiple shifts, with multiple different operators.  Second, the 11 plant scenario pushes costs upfront in order to minimize the annual costs.  This is beneficial, because upfront costs may be paid for through a fundraiser or donor, whereas annual costs will fall to the unwealthy inhabitants of the island.  We believe that everything that can be done to minimize costs to inhabitants, should be done. Please see calculations below where savings associated with our chosen scenario are calculated.


| Comparison | Annual Savings  | Years to recover initial Deficit   |    
|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|8 vs. 24    |     10,900      |           6.6                      | 
|8 vs. 12    |    2,700        |           7.2                      | 
|12 vs. 24   |    8,100        |           6.4                      |



```python
#Compare 12 hour to 24 hour
annual_savings_12_24= total_annual_cost_24hr - total_annual_cost_12hr
initial_deficit_12_24 = total_upfront_cost_12hr - total_upfront_cost_24hr
yrs_recover_12_24 = initial_deficit_12_24/annual_savings_12_24
print('In one year, the 12hr plant saves ' ,annual_savings_12_24, 'compared to the 24hr plant.')
print('Therefore, after ',yrs_recover_12_24, 'years of operation, the initial deficit of the 12 hr plant will be recovered.')

#Compare 8 hour to 24 hour
annual_savings_8_24= total_annual_cost_24hr - total_annual_cost_8hr
initial_deficit_8_24 = total_upfront_cost_8hr - total_upfront_cost_24hr
yrs_recover_8_24 = initial_deficit_8_24/annual_savings_8_24
print('In one year, the 8hr plant saves ' ,ut.sig(annual_savings_8_24,5), 'compared to the 24hr plant.')
print('Therefore, after ',yrs_recover_8_24, 'years of operation, the initial deficit of the 8 hr plant will be recovered.')

#Compare 8 hour to 12 hour
annual_savings_8_12= total_annual_cost_12hr - total_annual_cost_8hr
initial_deficit_8_12 = total_upfront_cost_8hr - total_upfront_cost_12hr
yrs_recover_8_12 = initial_deficit_8_12/annual_savings_8_12
print('In one year, the 8hr plant saves ' ,annual_savings_8_12, 'compared to the 12 hour plant')
print('Therefore, after ',yrs_recover_8_12, 'years of operation, the initial deficit of the 8 hr plant will be recovered')

```

    In one year, the 12hr plant saves  8144 dollar compared to the 24hr plant.
    Therefore, after  6.445 dimensionless years of operation, the initial deficit of the 12 hr plant will be recovered.
    In one year, the 8hr plant saves  10858 USD compared to the 24hr plant.
    Therefore, after  6.621 dimensionless years of operation, the initial deficit of the 8 hr plant will be recovered.
    In one year, the 8hr plant saves  2715 dollar compared to the 12 hour plant
    Therefore, after  7.151 dimensionless years of operation, the initial deficit of the 8 hr plant will be recovered

It should be noted, that near the completion of our project, we received information deeming the lake water unusable. According to David Buck at CH2M Hill, the lake water is too salty, and would need to be treated using an expensive process like reverse-osmosis.  He indicated that future plans will aim to use well water.  The Siriqui well at the moment is non-functional.  When functional, it is not known whether it has the capability of servicing the entire community during the dry season.  The inhabitants currently use spring water which is connected to their distribution system during the rainy season (3 months) and import bottled water for the rest of the year.

Below is a photograph provided by David Buck of the functional distribution system in the Siriqui community.  The well is marked by a light blue circle inside a white box.  There is a pipe (lavender line) connecting the well to the storage tank in Siriqui (white box with blue outline).  An Aguaclara plant could be constructed between the well and the storage tank to treat well water.
