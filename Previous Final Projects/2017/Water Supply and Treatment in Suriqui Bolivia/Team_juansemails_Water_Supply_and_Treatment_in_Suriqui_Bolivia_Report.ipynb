    "## **Introduction** \n",
    "Suriqui is an island community on the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca that requires a system for water supply and treatment.  Currently, the area has no reliable method of water treatment and distribution. For this reason, potential water treatment/distribution systems are being identified. The communities often rely on expensive bottled water, so this project is important to ensure that the communities have access to cheap, safe drinking water. Included below is a map of the island of Siriqui, and its four villages: Paco Chachacoma, Cayumpaya, Supicachi, and Suriqui (composed of four smaller villages, Ayjadero, Rosani, Yawirjani, and Yumani).  Populations are centered in three areas (the dashed line areas): Siriqui, Northwest, South Central.  These three population centers can either be connected by a single system, or served by three separate individual systems for each local community.  This report outlines a treatment plan for three separate systems in: Siriqui, the Northwest, and the South Central population centers.  The report focuses on a treatment plan for the largest community, Siriqui, which makes up approximately 60% of the population.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## **Chosen Design**\n",
    "After considering the information available, the chosen design is to provide an indoor treatment plant only for the population center of Suriqui.  This plant will be composed of either 4, 8, or 11 separate 1 L/s prefabricated water treatment systems.  With the different flow rates, it will require the operator to work either 24, 12, or 8 hours each day respectively as there will be a storage tank to collect the excess water.\n",
    "\n",
    "This area also has a working distribution network [1]. Electricity access to this area is not ideal as during thunderstorms the population center experiences power blackouts [2].  Because of this, the water pumps used will be run on diesel in order to avoid plant shutdown during thunderstorms.  The island would rather use lake water than well water [2], for this reason, the inlet pipe will draw water in from the lake. The water will be drawn from the lake via a diesel pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Identification:** \n",
    "Is it cheaper to construct three separate small water treatment plants in the respective communities or construct one large one that is accompanied by a distribution system for the entire island?  Additionally, what sort of design specifications are most beneficial to the community? Is it better to run a treatment plant for 24 hours a day or for 12 or 8 hours a day with a storage tank? Decisions regarding design specifications include:  (1) location of plant, (2) water source and size of inlet pipe (lake, spring, or well water),  (3) hours of plant operation, (4) type of pump, (5) source of electrical power for pump (power grid or diesel pump), (6) presence of water meters in homes \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Solution:** \n",
    "We will identify the costs relating to the construction of separate water treatment systems accounting for the decisions specified above, as well as the feasibility of properly delivering safe drinking water throughout the island.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Important Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The important constraints are to minimize cost, maintenance, and space.  To minimize costs, we have developed a design that favors upfront costs that ideally can be covered by a fund rather than later costs to be paid by taxpayers on the island.  Additionally, we will try to minimize primarily the distance the water must be pumped, and secondarily the distance between the plants and the community.  The treatment system must be capable of handling the necessary flow rates for the island.  For the village of Siriqui, the required flow rate is 3.7 L/s.  The plant must be simple to construct and easy to operate. It may also be advantageous to limit the responsibilities of the plant operator as plant operators will be expensive. This is achieved by using AguaClara prefabricated 1 L/s plants.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Trade-offs:**\n",
    "There are some important tradeoffs to consider for this project. For instance, the more complicated the design is the more difficult it will be to find a competent operator. Also, the more flow required the larger the plant must be. For the single plant design, only one plant must be constructed but there will need to be many utility lines. However, for the multi plant design, several plants will need to be constructed, but there will need to be fewer connecting utility lines.  Some of the communities on the island already have distribution networks; the Siriqui community's distribution is functional and transports water to every house [5]. Another trade-off we will be considering is the trade-off between upfront and annual costs, particularly in regards to running the plant for 24 vs. 12 vs. 8 hours a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Perceived operator/user specifications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The specifications of the plant are that the qualified operator(s) should be literate and capable of reading a linear flow orifice meter.  In addition, the operator should be able to use mass conservation in order to calculate coagulant and chlorine dosage based on plant and chemical flow measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Major design alternatives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group is focusing on a design consisting of several different pre-fabricated plants, while our cohorts are considering a single civil work system.  The following design alternatives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Location of plant:** Plant must be located higher than the community.  The horizontal and vertical distances between the lake and the plant (pumping distance) should be minimized to reduce energy required for pumping.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Water source and size of inlet pipe.**  Possible water sources include:\n",
    "    1. Siriqui Spring & Storage Tank (only operational during rainy season, flow is unknown, water quality data available)\n",
    "    2. Siriqui Well (flow unknown, no water quality data available)\n",
    "    3. Lake (water quality data available for other sides of island, none for Siriqui side).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Hours of plant operation and associated number of plants/storage tanks:** \n",
    "    1. 24 hours/day with 4 plants and no storage tank\n",
    "    2. 12 hours/day with 8 plants and storage tank\n",
    "    3. 8 hours/day with 11 plants and storage tank\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Type of pump:** Pump must be able to deliver the necessary amount of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Source of power for pump:**\n",
    "    1. Electrical grid on island\n",
    "    2. Diesel-powered pump\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Water meters**\n",
    "    1. No water meters (households pay a flat rate for water, but upfront cost for meters and installation)\n",
    "    2. Water meters (households pay for the amount of water they use, typically saves money)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Comparison of the major design alternatives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our prefabricated design will consist of several plants while our cohorts will design one civil work plant.The pre-fabricated plan consists of 4, 8 or 11 plants that each can handle smaller flow rates whereas the single system would have to be large enough to handle the combined flow rate. This decision will have to be based on the trade off in cost of a single plant and many utility connections versus the cost of several smaller plants and much fewer utility connections. Having more smaller plants also has the advantage of still producing water in other parts of the island if one of the plants were to fail. The design decision will also be based on the trade-off of annual and upfront costs associated with running the plants for 8, 12 or 24 hours a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Location of plant:** \n",
    "Many locations can be considered.  Two notable options considered are the high elevations on the Ayhadero and Yumani/Yawirjani peninsulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Water source and size of inlet pipe.**  \n",
    "The lake is deemed to be most feasible water source, as the flows of the spring and well are probably not sufficient to provide water to the entire community.  A combination of the sources was considered, but would require additional pumps, which would be expensive and require maintenance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Hours of plant operation and associated number of plants/storage tanks:** \n",
    "The three options (8, 12, and 24 hour operation) are considered and costs are analyzed below.  Having more than 4 plants would increase upfront costs while decreasing operator costs which would likely have to be paid for by the island inhabitants. \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Type of pump:** \n",
    "Many pump options can be considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Source of power for pump:**\n",
    "A diesel-powered pump was deemed to be the only option, as electricity is very unreliable on the island.  In addition, diesel is likely already being delivered to the island to run the island's power plant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Water meters**\n",
    "Water meters represent an upfront cost, but would likely conserve water and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "After consultation with the other group, this group will be working on multiple 1L/s plants as the other group works on a single plant to handle the entire island.  From further inspection, the island is broken up into three distinct population centers rather than 4 arbitrary villages.  To adjust the table from from the prompt, the population centers are broken down as follows:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we would recommend that 11 plants, operated for 8 hours a day, be constructed to service the residents of the Siriqui community.  We see 2 main benefits to the 8-hr a day scenario that will be most beneficial to the people of Siriqui.  First, an 8 hour workday is better than a 12 or 24 hour workday.  In the case of one shift per day, an 8 hour day is more ethical than a 12 hour day, and there would be no need to consider splitting the day into multiple shifts, with multiple different operators.  Second, the 11 plant scenario pushes costs upfront in order to minimize the annual costs.  This is beneficial, because upfront costs may be paid for through a fundraiser or donor, whereas annual costs will fall to the unwealthy inhabitants of the island.  We believe that everything that can be done to minimize costs to inhabitants, should be done. Please see calculations below where savings associated with our chosen scenario are calculated."

    "It should be noted, that near the completion of our project, we received information deeming the lake water unusable. According to David Buck at CH2M Hill, the lake water is too salty, and would need to be treated using an expensive process like reverse-osmosis.  He indicated that future plans will aim to use well water.  The Siriqui well at the moment is non-functional.  When functional, it is not known whether it has the capability of servicing the entire community during the dry season.  The inhabitants currently use spring water which is connected to their distribution system during the rainy season (3 months) and import bottled water for the rest of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a photograph provided by David Buck of the functional distribution system in the Siriqui community.  The well is marked by a light blue circle inside a white box.  There is a pipe (lavender line) connecting the well to the storage tank in Siriqui (white box with blue outline).  An Aguaclara plant could be constructed between the well and the storage tank to treat well water. \n",
